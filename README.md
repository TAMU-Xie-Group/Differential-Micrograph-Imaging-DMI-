# Differential-Micrograph-Imaging-DMI-

#In this work, we introduce differential micrograph imaging (DMI), a technique developed to reveal subtle microstructural changes associated with strain localization in polished and etched #metallic samples subjected to mechanical loading. The method first applies image registration to suppress rigid body motion and global deformation. A pixel-wise subtraction from the #undeformed reference micrograph then isolates contrast variations arising from localized strain. DMI does not require speckle patterning and leverages information from every pixel in the #micrograph. In contrast, digital image correlation (DIC) relies on surface patterning, and its spatial resolution is fundamentally limited by the subset and speckle size. While DMI is a #semi-quantitative technique, where heat map intensity correlates with relative strain magnitude, it does not provide exact strain values or directions. Nonetheless, DMI can serve as a #complementary technique to DIC by enabling high-resolution visualization of localized microstructural changes, particularly in regions with complex features and subtle deformation-induced #microstructure changes.
